# Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure

## Connecting to a Workspace

SDK Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py

**Method-1**
```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

**Method-2**
```python
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.get(name='aml-workspace',
                   subscription_id='1234567-abcde-890-fgh...',
                   resource_group='aml-resources')
```

## Automated Machine Learning

**There are three main steps to run an automated machine learning experiment using the user interface:**

1. Specify a dataset containing the features and label data you want to use to train the model.

2. Configure the automated machine learning experiment run â€“ including its name, the target label you want to train a model to predict, and the compute target on which to run the experiment.

3. Select the task type (classification, regression, or time-series), configuration settings, and featurization settings you want to apply in the experiment.

## Automated Machine Learning

An experiment is a named process, usually the running of a script or a pipeline, that can generate metrics and outputs and be tracked in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

```python
from azureml.core import Experiment

# create an experiment variable
experiment = Experiment(workspace = ws, name = "my-experiment")

# start the experiment
run = experiment.start_logging()

# experiment code goes here

# end the experiment
run.complete()
```
