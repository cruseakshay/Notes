# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

What is neural network ?
what is ReLu (Rectified Linear Units) function ?

Given enough/largeAmounts data neural networks are extremly good at figuring out the mapping function that maps x -> y.

m - size of training set.

Think{ Data, Computation, Algorithm}

Switching sigmoid with relu led to efficient computation.

### Week 2

Binary classification.

Logistic Regression is the algorithm for binary classification.

forward pass -> forward propogation
backward pass -> backward propogation

Difference between Loss function and cost function ?

Convex and non convex function.

local and global minima.

derivatives and partial derivatives.

what is computation graph ?

One step of backward propagation on a computation graph yields derivative of final output variable.

chain rule of differential calculus.

what is vectorization ?
