# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

What is neural network ?
what is ReLu (Rectified Linear Units) function ?

Given enough/largeAmounts data neural networks are extremly good at figuring out the mapping function that maps x -> y.

m - size of training set.

Think{ Data, Computation, Algorithm}

Switching sigmoid with relu led to efficient computation.

### Week 2

Binary classification.

Logistic Regression is the algorithm for binary classification.

forward pass -> forward propogation
backward pass -> backward propogation

Difference between Loss function and cost function ?
