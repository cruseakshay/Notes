- The ternary operator is permitted to have expressions that donâ€™t have matching types.
- The expression (z=false) assigns the value false to z and returns false for the entire expression.
- byte + byte is promoted to int.
- The * and % have the same operator precedence.

## Learning process

- Pause for a moment and think about the concept.
- Understand the behaviour of the code you write.

## For exam

- imagine all the scenarios of the concepts you learnt, go ahead and code to see the behaviour.
- try to recall the concepts you learnt without help. this gets easier and faster with time and practice.

- Data types supported by switch statements include the following:
  - int and Integer, 
  - byte and Byte,
