## Understanding Files and Directories

A file is record within a file system that stores user and system data.

A directory is a record within a file system that contains files as well as other directories.

the root directory is the topmost directory in the file system, from which all files and directories inherit. In Windows, it is denoted with a drive name such as
c:\, while on Linux it is denoted with a single forward slash /.

A path is a String representation of a file or directory within a file system.

path separator character that is used between directory entries.

The *absolute path* of a file or directory is the full path from the root directory to the file or directory, including all subdirectories that contain the file or directory.

The *relative path* of a file or directory is the path from the current working directory to file or directory.

For convenience, Java offers two options to retrieve the local separator character: *a system property* and *a static variable* defined in the File class.

```java
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("file.separator")); // sys ppt
    System.out.println(java.io.File.separator); // static var in File class
```

## The File Class

most commonly used: java.io.File class, or File class for short.

An instance of a File class represents the pathname of a particular file or directory on the file system.

The File class cannot read or write data within a file, although it can be passed as a reference to many *stream classes* to read or write data.

### Creating a File Object

A File object often is initialized with String containing either an absolute or relative path to the file or directory within the file system.

```java
    File file = new File("abs/rel path");
    // OR by joining paths.
    File parent = new File("/home/smith");
    // If the parent object happened to be null, then it would be skipped and the method would revert to our single String constructor.
    File child = new File(parent,"data/zoo.txt");
```

## Introducing Streams

The I/O streams that in this chapter are data streams and completely unrelated to the new Stream API.

### Stream Fundamentals

The contents of a file may be accessed or written via a stream , which is a list of data elements presented sequentially.

Each type of stream segments data into a "wave" or "block" in a particular way.

Some stream classes read or write data as individual byte values.

Other stream classes read or write individual characters or strings of characters.

### Stream Nomenclature

The java.io API provides numerous classes for creating, accessing, and manipulating streams.

#### Byte Streams vs. Character Streams

The java.io API defines two sets of classes for reading and writing streams:
those with Stream in their name and those with Reader/Writer in their name.

- Differences between Streams and Readers/Writers
  1. The stream classes are used for inputting and outputting all types of **binary or byte data**.
  2. The reader and writer classes are used for inputting and outputting only **character and String data**.

#### Input and Output

Most Input stream classes have a corresponding Output class and vice versa.

Example: FileOutputStream class writes data that can be read by a FileInputStream.

It follows, then, that most Reader classes have a corresponding Writer class.

Example: FileWriter class writes data that can be read by a FileReader.

- exceptions to the rules above:
  1. PrintWriter has no accompanying PrintReader class.
  2. PrintStream class has no corresponding InputStream class.

#### Low-Level vs. High-Level Streams

the java.io API also segments streams into *low-level* and *high-level* streams.

A low-level stream connects directly with the source of the data, such as a file, an array, or a String.
Low-level streams process the raw data or resource and are accessed in a direct and unfiltered manner.

A high-level stream is built on top of another stream using wrapping. Wrapping is the process by which an instance is passed to the constructor of another
class and operations on the resulting instance are filtered and applied to the original instance.

```java
try (
    // FileReader is the low-level stream reader
    // BufferedReader is the high-level stream that takes a FileReader as input
    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("zoo-data.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(bufferedReader.readLine());
}
```

> For the exam, the only low-level stream classes we need to be familiar with are the ones that operate on files. The rest of the non-abstract stream classes are all high-level streams.

#### Stream Base Classes

The java.io library defines four **abstract classes** that are the parents of all stream classes defined within the API:

- InputStream
- OutputStream
- Reader
- Writer

#### Decoding Java I/O Class Names

Table 8.2 describes those java.io streams you should be familiar with for the exam.

#### Common Stream Operations

streams are considered resources, it is imperative that they be closed after they are used lest they lead to resource leaks.

- Closing the Stream

    closing can accomplish by calling the close() method in a finally block or using the try-with-resource syntax.

- Flushing the Stream

    When data is written to an OutputStream, the underlying operating system does not necessarily guarantee that the data will make it to the file immediately.

    If the data is cached in memory and the application terminates unexpectedly, the data would be lost, because it was never written to the file system.

    Java provides a *flush()* method, which requests that all accumulated data be written immediately to disk.

    *close()* method will automatically call *flush()* method.

- Marking the Stream
    The InputStream and Reader classes include mark(int) and reset() methods to move the stream back to an earlier position.
    the markSupported() method, which returns true only if mark() is supported. trying to call mark(int) or reset() on a class that does not support these operations will throw an exception at runtime.
    if you call reset() after you have passed your mark() read limit, an exception may be thrown at runtime since the marked position may become invalidated.

- Skipping over Data
    The InputStream and Reader classes include a skip(long) method,skips over a certain number of bytes. It returns a long value, which indicates
    the number of bytes that were actually skipped. If the return value is zero or negative,then end of the stream was reached.

## Working with Streams

### The FileInputStream and FileOutputStream Classes

The data in a **FileInputStream** object is commonly accessed by successive calls to the *read()* method until a value of *-1* is returned, indicating that the end of the streamâ€”in this case the end of the file has been reached.

A **FileOutputStream** object is accessed by writing successive bytes using the *write(int)* method.

#### The BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream Classes

we can enhance the performance by wrapping the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes with the BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream classes.

Instead of reading the data one byte at a time, we use the underlying read(byte[]) method of BufferedInputStream, which returns the number of bytes read into the provided byte array.

- The number of bytes read is important for two reasons.
  1. if the value returned is 0, then we have reached the end of the file so stop reading from the BufferedInputStream.
  2. the last read of the file will likely only partially fill the byte array, since it is unlikely for the file size to be an exact multiple of our buffer array size.

The data is written into the BufferedOutputStream using the write(byte[],int,int) method, which takes as input a byte array, an offset, and a length value, respectively.

### The FileReader and FileWriter classes

Like the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes, the FileReader and FileWriter classes contain read() and write() methods, respectively.
These methods read/write char values instead of byte values.

The Writer class, which FileWriter inherits from, offers a *write(String)* method that allows a String object to be written directly to the stream. Using FileReader also allows you to pair it with BufferedReader in order to use the very convenient *readLine()* method.

only the Reader/Writer solution gives us structured access to the text data and also takes care of *character encoding*.
