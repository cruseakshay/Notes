Find a duplicate, Space Editionâ„¢.

We have an array of integers, where:

The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
The array has a length of n+1n+1
It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

Write a method which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array. (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)
