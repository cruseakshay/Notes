# Create Faceted Histograms
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
def create_facethists(df):
	import numpy as np
	cols = df.columns.tolist()[:-1]
	for col in cols:
		if(df[col].dtype in [np.int64, np.int32, np.float64] and df[col].name != "Diabetic"):
			g = sns.FacetGrid(frame, col="Diabetic")
			g.map(sns.distplot, col)
	return('Done')
create_facethists(frame)

Note: This code creates histograms for each numeric variable, faceted by the Diabetic label â€“ in
other words, it enables you to compare the distribution of numeric feature values for diabetic
and non-diabetic patients.


# Create Boxplots
def create_boxplots(df):
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	cols = df.columns.tolist()[:-1]
	for col in cols:
		if(df[col].dtype in [np.int64, np.int32, np.float64] and df[col].name != "Diabetic"):
			fig = plt.figure(figsize = (6,6))
			fig.clf()
			ax = fig.gca()
			df.boxplot(column = [col], ax = ax, by = ['Diabetic'])
	return('Done')
create_boxplots(frame)

Note: This code shows the same comparison of feature value distributions as box plots, which
make it easier to see the median and quartile values in the distributions.
