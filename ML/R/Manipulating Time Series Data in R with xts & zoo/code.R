# Manipulating Time Series Data in R with xts & zoo
# ch-1 Introduction to eXtensible Time Series, using xts and zoo for time series

# Load xts
library(xts)

# View the structure of ex_matrix
str(ex_matrix)

# Extract the 3rd observation of the 2nd column of ex_matrix
ex_matrix[3, 2]

# Extract the 3rd observation of the 2nd column of core 
core[3, 2]

# constructing xts
# Create the object data using 5 random numbers
data <- rnorm(5)

# Create dates as a Date class object starting from 2016-01-01
dates <- seq(as.Date("2016-01-01"), length = 5, by = "days")

# Use xts() to create smith
smith <- xts(x = data, order.by = dates)

# Create bday (1899-05-08) using a POSIXct date class object
bday <- as.POSIXct("1899-05-08")

# Create hayek and add a new attribute called born
hayek <- xts(x = data, order.by = dates, born = bday)

# Deconstructing xts
# Extract the core data of hayek
hayek_core <- coredata(hayek)

# View the class of hayek_core
class(hayek_core)

# Extract the index of hayek
hayek_index <- index(hayek)

# View the class of hayek_index
class(hayek_index)

# Time based indices
# Create dates
dates <- as.Date("2016-01-01") + 0:4

# Create ts_a
ts_a <- xts(x = 1:5, order.by = dates)

# Create ts_b
ts_b <- xts(x = 1:5, order.by = as.POSIXct(dates))

# Extract the rows of ts_a using the index of ts_b
ts_a[index(ts_b)]

# Extract the rows of ts_b using the index of ts_a
ts_a[index(ts_a)]

# Converting xts objects
# Convert austres to an xts object called au
au <- as.xts(austres)

# Then convert your xts object (au) into a matrix am
am <- as.matrix(au)

# Inspect the head of am
head(am)

# Convert the original austres into a matrix am2
am2 <- as.matrix(austres)

# Inspect the head of am2
head(am2)

# Importing data
# Create dat by reading tmp_file
dat <- read.csv(tmp_file, sep=",")

# Convert dat into xts
xts(dat, order.by = as.Date(rownames(dat), "%m/%d/%Y"))

# Read tmp_file using read.zoo
dat_zoo <- read.zoo(tmp_file, index.column = 0, sep = ",", format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Convert dat_zoo to xts
dat_xts <- as.xts(dat_zoo)

# Exporting xts objects
# Convert sunspots to xts using as.xts().
sunspots_xts <- as.xts(sunspots)

# Get the temporary file name
tmp <- tempfile()

# Write the xts object using zoo to tmp 
write.zoo(sunspots_xts, sep = ",", file = tmp)

# Read the tmp file. FUN = as.yearmon converts strings such as Jan 1749 into a proper time class
sun <- read.zoo(tmp, sep = ",", FUN = as.yearmon)

# Convert sun into xts. Save this as sun_xts
sun_xts <- as.xts(sun)

# Querying for dates
# Select all of 2016 from x
x_2016 <- x["2016"]

# Select January 1, 2016 to March 22, 2016
jan_march <- x["2016/2016-03-22"]

# Verify that jan_march contains 82 rows
82 == length(jan_march)

# Extracting recurring intraday intervals
# Extract all data from irreg between 8AM and 10AM
morn_2010 <- irreg["T08:00/T10:00"]

# Extract the observations in morn_2010 for January 13th, 2010
morn_2010["2010-01-13"]

# Row selection with time objects
# Subset x using the vector dates
x[dates]

# Subset x using dates as POSIXct
x[as.POSIXct(dates)]

# Update and replace elements
# Replace the values in x contained in the dates vector with NA
x[dates] <- NA

# Replace all values in x for dates starting June 9, 2016 with 0
x["2016-06-09/"] <- 0

# Verify that the value in x for June 11, 2016 is now indeed 0
x["2016-06-11"]
    
# Find the first or last period of time
# Create lastweek using the last 1 week of temps
lastweek <- last(temps, "1 week")

# Print the last 2 observations in lastweek
last(lastweek, 2)

# Extract all but the first two days of lastweek
first(lastweek, "-2 days")

# Combining first and last
# Extract the first three days of the second week of temps
first(last(first(temps, "2 weeks"), "1 week"), "3 days")

# Matrix arithmetic - add, subtract, multiply, and divide in time!
# Add a and b
a + b

# Add a with the numeric value of b
a + as.numeric(b)

# Math with non-overlapping indexes
# Add a to b, and fill all missing rows of b with 0
a + merge(b, index(a), fill = 0)

# Add a to b and fill NAs with the last observation
a + merge(b, index(a), fill = na.locf)

# Perform an inner join of a and b
merge(a, b, join = "inner")

# Perform a left-join of a and b, fill missing values with 0
merge(a, b, join = "left", fill = 0)

# Combining xts by row with rbind
# Row bind temps_june30 to temps, assign this to temps2
temps2 <- rbind(temps, temps_june30)

# Row bind temps_july17 and temps_july18 to temps2, call this temps3
temps3 <- rbind(temps2, temps_july17, temps_july18)

# Fill missing values using last or previous observation
# Fill missing values in temps using the last observation
temps_last <- na.locf(temps)

# Fill missing values in temps using the next observation
temps_next <- na.locf(temps ,fromLast = TRUE)

# NA interpolation using na.approx()
# Interpolate NAs using linear approximation
na.approx(AirPass)

# Create a leading object called lead_x
lead_x <- lag(x, k = -1)

# Create a lagging object called lag_x
lag_x  <- lag(x, k = 1)

# Merge your three series together and assign to z
z <- merge(lead_x, x, lag_x)
