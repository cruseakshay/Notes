# An Introduction to the Mathematics of Finance

- THE CONCEPT OF INTEREST
Interest may be regarded as a reward paid by one person or organization (the
borrower) for the use of an asset, referred to as capital, belonging to
another person or organization (the lender).

When expressed in monetary terms, capital is also referred to as principal.

If there is some risk of default (i.e., loss of capital or non-payment of interest),
a lender would expect to be paid a higher rate of interest than would otherwise
be the case; this additional interest is known as the risk premium.

## SIMPLE INTEREST

If an amount C is deposited in an account that pays simple interest at the rate of
i per annum and the account is closed after n years (there being no intervening
payments to or from the account), then the amount paid to the investor when
the account is closed will be \
C(1 + ni)

an important commercial application of simple interest is simple discount, which is commonly used for short-term loan transactions, i.e., up to 1 year.

under simple discount, the amount lent is determined by subtracting a discount from
the amount due at the later date. If a lender bases his short-term transactions on
a simple rate of discount d, then, in return for a repayment of X after a period t
(typically t < 1), he will lend X(1 - td) at the start of the period. In this situation,
d is also known as a rate of commercial discount
