# An Introduction to the Mathematics of Finance

- THE CONCEPT OF INTEREST
Interest may be regarded as a reward paid by one person or organization (the
borrower) for the use of an asset, referred to as capital, belonging to
another person or organization (the lender).

When expressed in monetary terms, capital is also referred to as principal.

If there is some risk of default (i.e., loss of capital or non-payment of interest),
a lender would expect to be paid a higher rate of interest than would otherwise
be the case; this additional interest is known as the risk premium.
