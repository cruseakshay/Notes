# Linear Classifiers in Python

## Applying logistic regression and SVM

[Dataset used](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

- Underfitting: model is too simple, low training accuracy
- Overfitting: model is too complex, low test accuracy
- Refer for Visualizing decision boundaries [Plot different SVM classifiers in the iris dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_iris.html)

## Loss functions
0-1 loss function for classification

scipy.optimize.minimize for optimizing functions

w@X represents the DOT product.

Logistic Loss (use plot x = raw model output, y = loss)

Hinge loss in SVM
