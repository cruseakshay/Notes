# Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost

## Notes

### Course Description

Gradient boosting is currently one of the most popular techniques for efficient modeling of tabular datasets of all sizes. XGboost is a very fast, scalable implementation of gradient boosting.

In this course, you'll learn how to use this powerful library alongside pandas and scikit-learn to build and tune supervised learning models.

### Classification with XGBoost

XGBoost is popular because of its Speed and performance. Its core algorithm is parallelizable even on GPUs.
